### Error handling

Note: this example will occasionally fail to behave correctly. This appears to be related to the existence of the other examples, as when this example is the only one on the page it works consistently. In the future, we may want to ensure that styleguidist examples are sandboxed.

```jsx harmony
import { DemoErrors } from "./readme";
<DemoErrors />;
```
